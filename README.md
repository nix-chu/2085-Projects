# 2085-Projects
*Projects from FIT Introduction to Computer Science class*

The following are the projects created during this class. This repository will be used as a reference for myself for future projects. This will also be used to store past scripts and code to apply new knowledge or reflect what could be improved. 

This class was an introduction to Computer Science which established my basic understanding. Topics covered include; Assembly Language, Time Complexity, Sorting Algorithms, Abstract Data Types, Iteration, and Recursion. Class was taught using Python. 

If you have not noticed, I am refraining from using the actual unit code for the class to prevent students from plagarising code. If you are a student of this class, congratulations for finding this repository. However, I am not liable for any penalties incurred due to plagarism, nor any marks lost due to different assignments/prac requirements.
